# Create a Docker Image and Deploy It on a Swarm Cluster

#### Description
##### Project objective: 
##### Create a Redis-based Docker image and deploy it on a Swarm cluster. Use Redis in a Swarm cluster for the data storage and caching purpose. Create a Redis-based Docker image using a Dockerfile and deploy this image on a Swarm cluster. Publish image to \Docker hub.

###### 1. Set Up Docker and Docker Swarm
Install Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. If not, install it from the official Docker website.
In this case, the lab provided by Simplilearn comes built in with Docker and 3 nodes.
Initialize Docker Swarm: Run docker swarm init on the manager node to initialize a new Swarm. If you have multiple nodes, you'll also need to add worker nodes to the swarm using the token generated by the init command.

###### 2. Create a Dockerfile for Redis
Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile for Redis. 

Build Docker Image: Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and build the Docker image using the Docker CLI. Run (docker build -t jamazubu/redis-image:latest . )

###### 3. Publish the Docker Image to Docker Hub
Run docker login and enter Docker Hub credentials. (jamazubu)
Push Docker Image to Docker Hub: After logging in, push your Docker image to Docker Hub by running          docker push jamazubu/redis-image:latest.

###### 4. Deploy the Redis Image on a Swarm Cluster
Create a Service in Swarm: Deploy your Redis image as a service in the Swarm cluster using the following command: docker service create --name redis-service --replicas 1 --publish published=6379,target=6379 jamazubu/redis-image:latest
This command creates a service named redis-service with one replica, and maps port 6379 on the swarm nodes to port 6379 on the Redis container.
